//! `SPEC_meshgen_geometry.md` §7.2–§7.4 — the local mesher for one cell, as a kernel.
//!
//! **Why this exists.** Gate G6-0 declined to build this and adopted the conforming centroid fan
//! instead. The fan is unconditionally valid, which is why the mesher is watertight everywhere,
//! but it abandons P3 by construction: it never cuts along the surface, so the material boundary
//! inside every cell it touches is off-surface by up to `h`. Phase P-3 re-opened that decision
//! with a measure that can see the damage (`[V13]`), and every cheaper route has now been tried
//! and closed with numbers — the `meets_inside` gate (fixed, and it was worth 26 % of the damage),
//! S7 curve conformity (unreachable by snapping at any cap), and driving the cap split from the
//! input's curve nodes (no gain, and it broke `[V3]`). What is left is the crease: ~75 % of the
//! remaining off-surface area lies within one element of a sharp edge of the input, and a **planar
//! cap cannot lie on a surface that creases inside the cell**. The crease has to be an edge of the
//! mesh, which means a mesher that takes the geometry as a *constraint* rather than approximating
//! it — this module.
//!
//! **The construction, and why not incremental Delaunay.** §7.4 asks for "constrained incremental
//! tetrahedralisation". What is normative there is the *properties* — determinism, constraints
//! respected, the Steiner rules — not the algorithm, and a Delaunay CDT with Steiner recovery is a
//! large amount of machinery whose failure modes are hard to bound. This kernel gets the same
//! properties from **successive convex clipping**: the cell is a tet, hence convex; clipping a
//! convex polyhedron by a plane yields two convex polyhedra; and a convex polyhedron tetrahedralises
//! by fanning from one of its own vertices with no Steiner point at all. Clip by every constraint
//! plane in a canonical order and every constraint surface comes out as a union of element faces,
//! which is exactly P3. Two patches that crease give two planes, and the crease is their
//! intersection line — an edge of the result by construction, without being special-cased.
//!
//! **What it does not do.** A patch is a bounded fragment and this clips by its whole supporting
//! plane, so a plane that only partly crosses the cell still cuts it all the way through. The extra
//! face is interior — both sides sample to the same region under §7.5 — so it costs elements and
//! never costs correctness. Bounding the cut to the fragment is what a true CDT buys and is the
//! next question this kernel makes askable, not one it answers.
//!
//! Determinism (R-P2, §7.4): planes are consumed in the caller's order, which is canonical by
//! construction; every vertex is interned through a `NodeKey` so a point computed twice is one
//! node; and each face's fan apex is its smallest key, so a face shared by two pieces is
//! triangulated identically from either side without negotiation (invariant J1).
